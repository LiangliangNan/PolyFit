 * @brief  LNS heuristic that combines the incumbent with the LP optimum
 * @author Timo Berthold
 *
 * RINS is a large neighborhood search improvement heuristic, i.e., it requires a known feasible solution. It solves a
 * sub-SCIP that is created by fixing variables which take the same value in the incumbent and the current node's LP
 * relaxation.
