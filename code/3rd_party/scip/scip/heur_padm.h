 * @brief  PADM primal heuristic based on ideas published in the paper
 *         "A Decomposition Heuristic for Mixed-Integer Supply Chain Problems"
 *         by Martin Schmidt, Lars Schewe, and Dieter Weninger
 * @author Dieter Weninger
 * @author Katrin Halbig
 *
 * The penalty alternating direction method (PADM) heuristic is a construction heuristic which additionally needs a
 * user decomposition with linking variables only.
 *
 * PADM splits the problem into several sub-SCIPs according to the decomposition, whereby the linking variables get
 * copied and the difference is penalized. Then the sub-SCIPs are solved on an alternating basis until they arrive at
 * the same values of the linking variables (ADM-loop). If they don't reconcile after a couple of iterations,
 * the penalty parameters are increased (penalty-loop) and the sub-SCIPs are solved again on an alternating basis.
