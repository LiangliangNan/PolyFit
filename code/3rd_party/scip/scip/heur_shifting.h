/**@file   heur_shifting.h

 * @brief  LP rounding heuristic that tries to recover from intermediate infeasibilities and shifts continuous variables
 * @author Tobias Achterberg
 *
 * This heuristic is similar to the Rounding heuristic (see @ref heur_rounding.h), but it tries to continue in the case
 * that no rounding can decrease the violation of a linear constraint.  In this case, the value of a continuous variable
 * or an integer variable with integral value will be shifted in order to decrease the violation of the constraint.  To
 * avoid cycling, the procedure terminates after a certain number of non-improving shifts.
