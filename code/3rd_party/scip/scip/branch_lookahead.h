 * @brief  lookahead LP branching rule
 * @author Christoph Schubert
 * @author Gerald Gamrath
 *
 * The (multi-level) lookahead branching rule applies strong branching to every fractional value of the LP solution
 * at the current node of the branch-and-bound tree, as well as recursivly to every temporary child problem created by this
 * strong branching. The rule selects the candidate with the best proven dual bound.
 *
 * The branching rule was motivated by the following technical report:
 *
 * @par
 * Wasu Glankwamdee and Jeff Linderoth@n
 * Lookahead Branching for Mixed Integer Programming@n
 * Technical Report 06T-004, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Lehigh University.
 *
 * For a more mathematical description and a comparison between lookahead branching and other branching rules
 * in SCIP, we refer to
 *
 * @par
 * Christoph Schubert@n
 * Multi-Level Lookahead Branching@n
 * Master Thesis, Technische Universit√§t Berlin, 2017@n
