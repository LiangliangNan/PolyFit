 * @author Timo Berthold

 *
 * Preroot primal heuristic that fixes variables and propagates these fixings. In each step, the heuristic fixes a
 * variable such that the number of violated LP rows gets maximally reduced.  The fixing is then propagated to reduce
 * further variable domains.  In case that the domain propagation detects the infeasibility of the current partial
 * solution, the domain is reset to its previous state and the variable is postponed.
