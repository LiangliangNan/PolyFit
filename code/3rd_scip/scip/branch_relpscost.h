 * @brief  reliable pseudo costs branching rule
 * @author Tobias Achterberg
 *
 * The reliable pseudo costs branching rule uses the notion of pseudo costs to measure the expected
 * gain in the dual bound when branching on a particular variable.
 * The pseudo cost information is collected during the branch-and-bound search in the same manner as for
 * the pseudo costs branching rule.
 *
 * The reliable pseudo costs branching rule, however, uses a limited number of look-ahead LP-iterations
 * at the beginning of the search in order to obtain better pseudo cost estimates and make branching decisions in a
 * sense more "reliable" at an early stage of the search,
 * at the price of a higher computational cost at the beginning of the search.
 *
 * For a more mathematical description and a comparison between the reliable pseudo costs rule and other branching rules
 * in SCIP, we refer to
 *
