 * @author Tobias Achterberg

 *
 * The inference history branching rule is based on the average number of deductions obtained after
 * branching this variable upwards and downwards.
 * Variables which cause many problem reductions are preferred since they are more likely to drive
 * the created sub-tree towards infeasibility.
 * Inference history of the variables is updated during the branch-and-bound search.
 *
 * For a more detailed description and a comparison between the inference rule and other branching rules
 * in SCIP, we refer to
