/**@file   heur_pscostdiving.h
 * @ingroup PRIMALHEURISTICS
 * @brief  LP diving heuristic that chooses fixings w.r.t. the pseudo cost values
 * @author Tobias Achterberg
 *
 * Diving heuristic: Iteratively fixes some fractional variable and resolves the LP-relaxation, thereby simulating a
 * depth-first-search in the tree. Pseudocost Diving chooses the variable with the smallest ratio of estimated objective
 * increase if rounding to either direction. If the variable is significantly different from its root LP vlaue, it will
 * be rounded into the direction it developed (see @ref heur_linesearchdiving.h), if it is close to an integral point,
 * it will be rounded to that one, otherwise it will be rounded into the direction of lower pseudocosts. One-level
 * backtracking is applied: If the LP gets infeasible, the last fixing is undone, and the opposite fixing is tried. If
 * this is infeasible, too, the procedure aborts.
