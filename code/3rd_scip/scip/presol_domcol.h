 * @brief  dominated column presolver
 * @author Dieter Weninger
 *
 * This presolver looks for dominance relations between variable pairs.
 * From a dominance relation and certain bound/clique-constellations
 * variable fixings mostly at the lower bound of the dominated variable can be derived.
 * Additionally it is possible to improve bounds by predictive bound strengthening.
